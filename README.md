# Human-Detection-HOG-SVM

This is the repository for the Group 11 final project of Multimedia Processing. In this project, we experiment with the HOG features with SVM classification for object detection. We also experiments with libHOG, which has faster processing time than HOG-SVM. The datasets we use will be from: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/constantinwerner/human-detection-dataset). In this project, we will be using Python to run HOG-SVM, and C++ to run libHOG.
